## Topics for Today

Today's meeting with touch on the following items.

- Logistics  
- Curricula    
- Looking Ahead  


# Logistics {background-color="black" background-image="media/contour.png" background-size="initial" background-position="right"}

## New Term Position

The last time I had a meeting with the Vice Provost, he suggested that we can move ahead on identifying and hiring a new term faculty member.

- VCU LS not initiated paperwork.
- No updates available.


## Thinking Ahead

I have tasked an *ad hoc* committee to think about the next tenure track hires for CES.  There is nothing on the horizon at this point (that I know of) but it is always nice to have something available immediately in case there is an opportunity that presents itself.

## Converting Classes

We've finished (almost) all of the CORE curriculum changes for both undergraduate and graduate programs.  


&nbsp;

:::{.fragment}
We now **must** convert all those 291, 391, 491, 591, and 691 classes to real numbers.

- Complete and updated syllabus.
- Small bulletin *blurb* (see bulletin for format).

## VP Strategic Enrollment

I had a meeting yesterday with Dr. Tomikia LeGrande about strategic enrollment.  We are working on some initiatives to do some targeted recruitment such as sending content to AP Environmental Science students.  


:::{.fragment}
She would like us to think of some recruiting tools as well:

- Small video of our work and programs to send to local Environmental HS classes.
- Additional materials that could be pushed out on social media.

## Program Review

From December 2021 until August 2022, there was a tremendous amount of work on the development, discussion, and production of the [2022 Environmental Studies Program Review](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IOkEXv30wql-0UY4BHG5ZREDZKENzpgD/view?usp=sharing).

## Social Meet & Greet

Lesley?


## Revising Assessment

Now that we've finished the program review **and** suggested several addions to the assessment processes we use, these need to be implemented.  I think at a first pass, we have what we need right now, but we will be reaching out for additional help/advice/thoughts going forward.

They recently did a story featuring Environmental Studies, so we though the first ad we try would be here.
